In this practice, you are expected to create a list of Arrays and define the objects in them. The creation of elements will be done via the Console screen.

So, after creating each array and adding it to the list, we need to ask the user whether he added a new array.



Then follow the steps below.

Create a new list from the comedy series that were on your first list. This list should only include TV Series Name / TV Series Type / Director information (So you need another class.)

 Print all the elements of this new list with all their properties on the screen. Make sure that the article is sorted based on the names of the series first and then the names of the directors.
